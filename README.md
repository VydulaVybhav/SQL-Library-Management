# SQL-Library-Management
Capstone Database Systems Project

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, our team of four software engineers designed and built a sophisticated and efficient SQL library database management system. We utilized industry-standard best practices and techniques to ensure the system was highly normalized, secure, scalable, and performance-oriented. Additionally, we implemented a front-end Java application to seamlessly interface with the SQL database, providing users with an intuitive and responsive experience. Rigorous testing and documentation were conducted throughout the project to guarantee quality and maintainability.

## Key Features

1. **Normalization and Data Types**:
   The database schema was designed using the principles of normalization (up to BCNF) to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity. We carefully selected appropriate data types for each attribute, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of information.

2. **Relationships and Constraints**:
   We established meaningful relationships between tables using primary and foreign key constraints, maintaining referential integrity. Additionally, we implemented check constraints and unique constraints to enforce business rules and guarantee data accuracy.

3. **Indexes and Performance Optimization**:
   To optimize query performance, we strategically created indexes on frequently accessed columns and tuned SQL queries for maximum efficiency. We also analyzed query execution plans to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

4. **Java Front-end Application**:
   Working in collaboration, we developed a user-friendly Java application that interacted with the SQL database. This application provided an intuitive interface for users to perform CRUD operations, search the catalog, and manage library transactions such as borrowing and returning books. Note: This repositorty only contains the SQL portion.

5. **Test Cases and Quality Assurance**:
   To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our system, we designed and executed a comprehensive suite of test cases for various queries and transactions. We employed unit testing, integration testing, and stress testing to validate the system's functionality, performance, and robustness.

6. **Documentation and Code Management**:
   Throughout the project, we maintained thorough documentation, including database schema diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, and technical specifications. We adhered to coding standards to ensure maintainability and collaboration among team members.

The final result was a robust, efficient, and user-friendly SQL library database management system that met the high standards set forth by our team and satisfied the project requirements.
